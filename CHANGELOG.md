### Fixes and improvements

* Fix checkpoint restore during evaluation when using a `PositionEmbedder` or a `DenseBridge` in the decoder
* Fix inputters parameter sharing: shared variables were overriden when the layer was invoked (requires retraining)

### New features

* New experimental model type `LanguageModel` to train generative language models (see the example [GPT-2 configuration](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/blob/master/config/models/gpt_2.py)). The usage is the same as a sequence to sequence model except that "labels" data should not be set.
* `cosine_annealing` learning rate decay

* Fix guided alignment training for TensorFlow versions older than 1.11
* Refactor the `Inputter` API
