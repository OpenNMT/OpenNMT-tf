## [1.5.0](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/releases/tag/v1.5.0) (2018-06-08)

### New features

* `MultistepAdamOptimizer` to simulate trainings with large batch size (credits to Tensor2Tensor, requires TensorFlow 1.6+)
* `--log_prediction_time` flag to summarize inference execution time:
  * total prediction time
  * average prediction time
  * tokens per second
* Training option `average_last_checkpoints` to automatically average checkpoints at the end of the training
* Command line options `--{inter,intra}_op_parallelism_threads` to control the level of CPU parallelism
* [*experimental*] Average attention network ([Zhang et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00631)) in the Transformer decoder

### Fixes and improvements

* Fix possible error when training RNN models with in-graph replication (time dimension mismatch)

### New features

* `score` run type to score existing predictions

### New features

* RNMT+ encoder
* L1, L2, and L1 L2 regularization penalties (see `regularization` parameter)

  * `outputs_layer_fn` applied on each encoder outputs
  * `combined_output_layer_fn` applied on the combined output

### Fixes and improvements

* Fix `SequenceClassifier` "last" encoding for variable length sequences

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/releases/tag/v1.2.0) (2018-04-28)

### New features

* Return alignment history when decoding from an `AttentionalRNNDecoder` (requires TensorFlow 1.8+ when decoding with beam search)
* Boolean parameter `replace_unknown_target` to replace unknown target tokens by the source token with the highest attention (requires a decoder that returns the alignment history)
* Support for arbitrary transition layers in `SequentialEncoder`

### Fixes and improvements

* Fix sequence reduction when the maximum sequence length is not equal to the tensor time dimension (e.g. when splitting a batch for multi-GPU training)
* The number of prefetched batches is automatically tuned when `prefetch_buffer_size` is not set (for TensorFlow 1.8+)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/releases/tag/v1.1.0) (2018-04-12)

### New features

* Update the OpenNMT tokenizer to 1.3.0 and use its Python package instead of requiring a manual compilation (Linux only)
* Include a catalog of models in the library package and allow model selection with the `--model_type` command line option

### Fixes and improvements

* Fix error when using FP16 and an `AttentionMechanism` module (for TensorFlow 1.5+)
* Manual export will remove default-valued attributes from the NodeDefs (for TensorFlow 1.6+)
* Silence some deprecation warnings with recent TensorFlow versions
* Training option `sample_buffer_size` now accepts special values:
  * `0` or `null` to disable shuffling

* Improve the Transformer decoder mask construction (up to 10% speedup during training)

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-tf/releases/tag/v1.0.1) (2018-03-14)

### Fixes and improvements
