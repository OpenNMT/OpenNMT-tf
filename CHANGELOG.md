OpenNMT-tf follows [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). The API covers:

* command line options

### Breaking changes

See the [2.0 Transition Guide](docs/v2_transition.md) for details about the following changes.

* TensorFlow 2.0 is now required
* Python 3.5 or greater is now required
* Checkpoints are no longer compatible as the code now uses object-based instead of name-based checkpointing (except Transformer checkpoints which are automatically upgraded when loaded)
* The `onmt-main` script now makes use of subparsers which require to move the run type and it specific options to the end of the command
* Some predefined models have been renamed or changed, see the [transition guide](docs/v2_transition.md#changed-predefined-models)
* Some parameters in the YAML configuration have been renamed or changed, see the [transition guide](docs/v2_transition.md#changed-parameters)

* TFRecord files generated with the `opennmt.inputters.write_sequence_record` function or the `onmt-ark-to-records` script are no longer compatible and should be re-generated

This version also changes the public API scope of the project:
