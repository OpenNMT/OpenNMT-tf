# Parameters

Run parameters are described in separate YAML files. They define data files, optimization settings, dynamic model parameters, and options related to training and inference. It uses the following layout:

```yaml
model_dir: path_to_the_model_directory

data:
  # Data configuration (training and evaluation files, vocabularies, alignments, etc.)
params:
  # Training and inference hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, beam size, etc.)
train:
  # Training specific configuration (checkpoint frequency, number of training step, etc.)
eval:
  # Evaluation specific configuration (evaluation frequency, external evaluators.)
infer:
  # Inference specific configuration (output scores, alignments, etc.)
score:
  # Scoring specific configuration
```

## Automatic configuration

Predefined models declare default parameters that should give solid performance out of the box. To enable automatic configuration, use the `--auto_config` flag:

```bash
onmt-main --model_type Transformer --config my_data.yml --auto_config train
```

The user provided `my_data.yml` file will minimally require the data configuration (see [Quickstart](quickstart.md) for example). You might want to also configure checkpoint related settings, the logging frequency, and the number of training steps.

At the start of the training, the configuration values actually used will be logged. If you want to change some of them, simply add the parameter in your configuration file to override the default value.

**Note:** default training values usually assume GPUs with at least 8GB of memory and a large system memory:

* If you encounter GPU out of memory issues, try overriding `batch_size` to a lower value.
* If you encounter CPU out of memory issues, try overriding `sample_buffer_size` to a fixed value.

## Multiple configuration files

The command line accepts multiple configuration files so that some parts can be made reusable, e.g:

```bash
onmt-main --config config/opennmt-defaults.yml config/optim/adam_with_decay.yml \
    config/data/toy-ende.yml [...]
```

If a configuration key is duplicated, the value defined in the rightmost configuration file has priority.

If you are unsure about the configuration that is actually used or simply prefer working with a single file, consider using the `merge_config` script:

```bash
onmt-merge-config config/opennmt-defaults.yml config/optim/adam_with_decay.yml \
    config/data/toy-ende.yml > config/my_config.yml
```
